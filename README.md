# InsultBot
A simple Discord bot designed to help insult your friends.

## Overview
InsultBot allows you to insult your friends simply by saying `$insult`.
Usage can be a lot more flexible than that as well: `$insult @user` will insult a specific user or role,
or `$insult your mom` will say nasty things about your mother. Be nice to her.

Anyway, this is a side project that I continue to maintain as it breaks, so I won't document very much.
If for some reason you'd like to learn about this mess just send me a message and I'll be happy to write up
some docs then.
